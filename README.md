- Team project created as part of the Human-Centered Product Development course.
  - Involvement included project management, ideation, video editing, and course-related tasks like writing blog posts.
- The Travelling Companion concept was developed based on the following prerequisites: "How could new technologies improve the passenger experience of public transport in the future? Can novel technologies help consumers make sustainable choices when planning a journey or guide the passenger during the trip? We hope that you consider at least railway traffic as a part of the journey, but we encourage you to look at the whole journey from your doorstep to the destination."
